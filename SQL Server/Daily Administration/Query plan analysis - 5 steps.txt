     - Lookup
          Missing columns in index

     - Spool 
          (used as a "cache" in the query processor)
          Lack of adequate indexes or uniqueness information (can be overridden by DISTINCT or Unique Keys)
          Hidden tables in tempDB, not a good sign
          Distinct values on query (FROM (SELECT DISTINCT)) removes the spool or OPTION QUERYTRACEON 8690

     - Sort
          Check expectations and indexes

     - Hash
          Heavily impact on tempDB
          Failed to create an index somewhere     

     - Nested Loops (serial)
          Works best with small outer (top) input

     -* Scan
                 Often appropriate
          Trace Flag OPTION(QUERYTRACEON 9130) - Disables residual predicates 
                                                 and forces the query optimizer to process as filter
                                                 High IO but thin lines only showing up
